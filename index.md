## About Me

I am Pierre Marrec, a PhD student at INRIA Grenoble, affiliated with the Université Grenoble Alpes. I am passionate about motion analysis and computer vision applied to sports. I am driven by the challenge of enabling machines to perceive and understand complex human motion from diverse sensory inputs. My core interest lies in developing robust 3D human pose estimation and motion analysis techniques, particularly leveraging multi-view camera systems and multimodal data fusion.
My academic path started at ENS Lyon, where I completed my Master's degree, leading to my current doctoral studies.

Beyond my main research, I actively participate in science communication. I've run workshops for events like Fête de la Science and Geek Touch, contributed to the french peer-reviewed science blog [Papier-Mâché](https://papiermachesciences.org/).

Outside of academics, I am a keen sports enthusiast, enjoying trail running, and climbing. I previously had a significant focus on combat sports. I also enjoy working on personal projects, such as analyzing my Garmin data and developing tools to automate parts of my research workflow using Obsidian.

## Research Focus & Expertise

My primary research interest is **3D Computer Vision for Human Motion Understanding**, with a strong emphasis on:
*   **Robust 3D Human Pose and Shape Estimation:** From multi-view videos and other sensor modalities.
*   **Multimodal Data Fusion:** Integrating visual information with data from sources like IMUs or Force Plates for comprehensive motion capture.
*   **Dynamic Scene Understanding:** Including tracking, action recognition, and forecasting in complex human-centric scenarios like sports.
*   **Large Vision Models & Generative AI:** Exploring their application to synthesize, analyze, and predict human motion and appearance.
*   **Applications in Sports Science:** Developing tools for performance analysis, biomechanical studies, and tactical insights.

My other research interests include:
*   **Reinforcement Learning:** I'm interested in using RL to optimize human motion analysis and interaction with the environment from videos.
*   **Applications of NLP to Visual Reasoning:** I'm interested in using NLP Reasoning inside a visual pipeline to improve the robustness of the system.
*   **Interpretable AI:** I'm interested in developing interpretable AI models to improve the trustworthiness of the system and get insights on how to progress for an athlete.

## Personal Projects

Beyond my primary research, I enjoy working on personal projects that allow me to explore different technologies and applications:

*   **[Garmin Data Analysis and Visualization](https://github.com/piromagnus/garminDataAnalysis):** Developing tools for analyzing and visualizing personal sports data exported from Garmin devices to monitor my training. This involves data processing and creating informative dashboards.
*   **[AI Research Automation Tools](https://github.com/piromagnus/researchNautomation):** Building tools to streamline parts of the research process. This includes automating Scientific Papers diggestions, custom weekly new papers curation and custom Deep Research. Everything is made to be integrated in my personal knowledge base, made with Obsidian.
