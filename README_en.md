## About me

I am Pierre Marrec, a PhD student passionate about motion analysis and computer vision applied to sports. My academic journey has led me from ENS Lyon, where I completed my Master's degree, to my current doctoral project.

## Research

My thesis focuses on the contribution of motion analysis for longitudinal monitoring of athletes. I use computer vision models to analyze videos of sports performances, aiming to help estimate athletes' progress, workload, and physical characteristics.

### Areas of expertise
- Computer vision
- Markerless motion analysis
- Human motion and pose estimation
- Neural networks

## Projects

- Data analysis and visualization using my own Garmin data
- Human mesh reconstruction in a sports context, with improvements in shape and multi-person tracking

## Science Communication

I am involved in various science communication activities:
- Workshops at events like Fête de la Science and Geek Touch
- Member of Papier-Mâché, a science popularization blog following the peer-review principle
- Former YouTube channel [Infolie](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1udm4yGSuEV7QwHANDHtLQ/videos) explaining basic computer science concepts for everyone

## Other interests

Outside of my academic activities, I am an avid sports enthusiast. I enjoy running, trail running, climbing, and table tennis, with a particular focus on combat sports.
