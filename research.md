# Research

My research centers on **3D Computer Vision for Human Understanding**, with a particular focus on advancing how machines perceive, analyze, and predict human motion. I am especially interested in applications within sports science, biomechanics, and human-computer interaction.

## PhD Research: Computer Vision for High-Level Sport Athlete Analysis
*(Commencing October 2024 at INRIA / LJK, Université Grenoble Alpes)*

My doctoral work aims to develop novel computer vision techniques for comprehensive analysis of high-level athletes. Key research axes include:

*   **Multi-view 3D Human Pose and Shape Estimation:** Creating robust and accurate systems to reconstruct detailed 3D human models (pose and body shape) from multiple synchronized camera views. This involves tackling challenges like occlusion, complex motions, and varied lighting conditions.
*   **Fusion of Multimodal Motion Data:** Integrating visual data with information from other sensors (e.g., Inertial Measurement Units - IMUs, pressure sensors) to achieve a more holistic and precise understanding of an athlete's movement and kinematic parameters.
*   **Inverse Kinematics and Biomechanical Modeling:** Translating observed motion data into underlying biomechanical parameters and joint kinematics, providing deeper insights into movement strategies and potential injury risks.
*   **Large Vision Models for Temporal Action Analysis:** Investigating and adapting state-of-the-art large vision models (LVMs) and video foundation models for tasks such as fine-grained action recognition, temporal segmentation of athletic movements, and prediction of future actions or performance outcomes.

The ultimate goal is to develop tools that can provide actionable feedback to athletes and coaches, enhance performance, and contribute to injury prevention strategies.
